## ✨ What it does

- Persists UI configurations for the companion **Drag And Drop Card**.
- Exposes a simple backend inside Home Assistant so the card can **save**, **load**, and **delete** its layouts/configs.
- Syncs dashboard `packages` payloads to Home Assistant package YAML files.
- Uses Home Assistant’s standards (config entries, services, storage helpers) so everything lives neatly within your HA setup.

## 📦 Installation

### Option A — HACS (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS → Integrations → 3‑dot menu → Custom repositories**.
2. Add the repository: `https://github.com/Prosono/Drag-And-Drop-Card-Backend` as type **Integration**.
3. Find **Drag-And-Drop-Card Backend** in HACS and click **Download**.
4. Go into "**Settings**" then "**Devices and Services**" And Click "**Add Integration**"
5. Search for "**Drag And Drop Card Backend**" and select it. 
4. Restart Home Assistant after the installation is complete.

### Option B — Manual

1. Copy the folder `custom_components/drag_and_drop_card_backend` from this repo
   into your Home Assistant config directory at:
   `config/custom_components/drag_and_drop_card_backend/`.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

> Your HA config directory is typically `~/.homeassistant` or `/config` (if using HA OS / Supervised).

## 🧰 Usage

The backend is designed to be used by the front-end **Drag And Drop Card**. Typical flows:

- **Save a layout** from the card → backend persists it.
- **Load a layout** on dashboard render → backend returns it.
- **Delete a layout** → backend removes it.

### Home Assistant packages

When a saved dashboard payload includes `packages`, the backend writes enabled package YAML to:

```text
/config/packages/ddc_<storage_key>_<package_slug>.yaml
```

Only packages where `enabled` is not `false` and `yaml` is not empty are written. Filenames use Home Assistant compatible single-underscore slugs because package names are derived from the filename. When packages are renamed, disabled, removed, or when a dashboard is deleted, matching generated `ddc_*.yaml` files are cleaned up. Older legacy `ddc__*.yaml` files are also detected and cleaned up automatically.

Home Assistant must have packages enabled in `configuration.yaml`, for example:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages
```

`!include_dir_merge_named packages` is also supported by Home Assistant setups that prefer that style. The frontend can check package setup with:

```text
GET /api/dragdrop_storage_package_status
```

The namespaced alias follows the same route pattern:

```text
GET /api/drag_and_drop_card_backend_package_status
```

### Discovering services

The integration is designed so that you do not have to do any manual operations for saving / retreiving saved dashboards. 

## 📁 Files & Structure

```

  ├── __init__.py
  ├── manifest.json
  ├── config_flow.py        # UI-based setup
  ├── services.yaml         # Service schemas (if present)

> File list may vary by release, but the integration follows standard HA component conventions.

## 🧪 Development

### Local dev with HA

1. Create a Home Assistant dev instance (e.g., with HA Container or a test HA OS VM).
2. Mount/link the component to `/config/custom_components/drag_and_drop_card_backend`.
3. Enable **Advanced Mode** in your HA user profile for extra dev tools.
4. Watch the **Logs** (Settings → System → Logs) while reloading the integration.

### Linting / typing (suggested)

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format .
mypy custom_components/drag_and_drop_card_backend
```

### Versioning & releases

- Follow semantic versioning.
- Use GitHub Releases and update `manifest.json` version accordingly.

## 📝 FAQ

**Where are layouts stored?**  
Inside Home Assistant’s storage (e.g., `.storage`), handled by the integration. You normally don’t need to manage these files manually.

**Where are generated packages stored?**  
In `/config/packages` using filenames that start with `ddc_`. These files are generated from dashboard payloads and are cleaned up by the backend when the source dashboard or package changes.

**Can I back up the data?**  
Yes — use HA’s built-in **Backups** (Snapshots) to capture everything.

**Do I need the front-end card?**  
This backend is meant to be paired with the Drag And Drop Card. On its own, it won’t render UI — it just stores and serves configs.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- Data is stored locally within your Home Assistant instance.
- No cloud sync is performed by the backend unless you add it yourself via HA add-ons or external automations.
